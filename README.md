# PyTrackingToolbox
A target tracking toolbox developed in Python. It aims to demonstrate how target tracking works and to serve as a testbed for target tracking scenarios.

If you use the code provided here for projects or research papers, please cite this repo and, of course, cite the source of the original MATLAB code.

### Prerequisites
These scripts and modules use the typical Python libraries for computational science and engineering, such as numpy and matplotlib. In addition, to obtain nice plots with LaTeX annotations, you must have LaTeX on your computer.
